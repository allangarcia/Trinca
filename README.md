# Trinca

This is my following along on cs193p course from Stanford in 2020

## A little talk!

Hi, my name is Allan Garcia... this repository (and probably others) is my study over the course cs193p from Stanford.

It is available at https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu

## The YouTube channel was shut down

Once upon a time a video channel about those exercises I did on camera existed.

Unfortunately, there is no more, the reasons are many, but I'll summarize in a few:

1. No content that is not in English is well monetized on YouTube
2. Did take a lot of my time, first coding the solution, then scripting in Portuguese, then shooting, then editing, then thumbnails, marketing, etc. with no sponsor to do it, and as I mentioned, no monetization from YouTube.
3. I didn't had the time to finish the last series of videos, resolving Trinca (an exercise from CS193p from Stanford), so I decided to shut everything down and re-thing my channel. Will be not under a pseudo name anymore, but in my main account. Allan Garcia itself.
